            <h3>Fountain Pens</h3>
            <p>Our fountain pens feature a custom nib grind by nibmeister Eric Liu, in options Fine Cursive Smooth Italic, Medium Cursive Smooth Italic, or Architect. The nib grind still provides nice line variation while providing a smoother writing experience in a larger variety of writing positions/angles. An italic nib writes more broadly on the downstrokes, and narrow on the sidestrokes. </p>
            <p>These fountain pens are handmade from hardened basaltic lava sourced from the Mount Etna volcano in Italy, with a trim made of solid bronze. Visconti lava is virtually unbreakable, comfortable and warm to the touch - and slightly hygroscopic, absorbing moisture from your hand. The basaltic lava is mixed with resin to create this pen.</p>
            <p>The pen caps using the Visconti 'Hook Safe Lock', a revolutionary capping system so you can cap a pen without worrying about the cap accidentally unscrewing in your pocket and leaking. The fountain pen's vacuum power filler is made of titanium to resist ink corrosion, and it features an oversized 18kt rose gold nib to match the trim color. You can also customize this pen with the magnetized MyPen System. We offer natural stones that you can swap into the finial in place of the Visconti logo coin.</p>

            <h3>Fineliner Pens</h3>
            <p>For those interested in casual everyday usage pens, we recommend our fineliner pens. Fineliner pens are a class of fine fibre or plastic tip pens that are typically used for graphic, drawing or sketching purposes, but are also popular for handwriting as many people like the unique feel of the tip compared to a traditional ball-tipped pen. </p>
            <p>Our fineline pens are an enduring favorite among students, artists and writers. Its plastic tip allows for accurate, reliable lines but also has a small amount of give. This softness allows for slight line variation that imbues drawings with subtle character. It also gives the pen a natural feel. The ink flows easily and is quite dark without piercing through the page. Its archival-quality pigment ink is also Copic-proof, so itâ€™s the perfect choice for multi-media artwork and writing that needs to last. It comes in 15 colors and sizes ranging from 003 to 08.</p>
